How we will interact
============================

The buyer will be our neighbor, so I'm interested in talking to the buyer in person. We are not selling to an anonymous buyer. You're encouraged to hire any real estate professional, but we'll need to meet and talk in person. Negotiations will be 1:1. If you get serious, we should inspect every nook and cranny and I'll tell you what I know (see below). 

Disclosures and vetting
===================================

You can read the property docs, but nothing is as good as talking to me in depth. I'll will give you my opinion as a contractor and someone who has lived there. I will be your neighbor and will therefore make every effort to help you learn about the house you're planning on buying.

Freebies
===============

Mother-law-apartment
----------------------

The house already has a separate apartment with a private entrance. Renting that would pay 40% of your mortgage.

Dirtwork
-------------------

I own a lot of equipment so I can rough in your landscaping as you wish. I have topsoil, woodchips, and sand fill material on site.

Tree planting
-------------------------------

My skid steer tree spade allows me to move 2-7 foot trees dpending on the species. I'll transplant at no charge maple, oak, white pine, fir, and black walnut. I've gone to great lengths to plant trees that will increase privacy. Let me know what you need.

Add-ons
=========================

Additional shop
-------------------------------

I'm interested in selling the 1000 s.f. shop across from the house, so adding that is a possibility. I would consider selling that on a land contract. Sale is subject to Garfield approving a change in lot lines.

Build-to-suit
=========================

It's possible you can include a remodel and upgrades in your purchase. Perhaps some work could be built into the price. Alternatively, you could start with a construction loan. That might be a good idea if you think interest rates will decline (likely) in the next 6-12 months. 

Labor is tight these days, but I currently have a journeyman carpenter on hand, so it's possible. The house is big and open and therefore has much potential. I can see a gazebo in the backyard and a large deck overlooking the creek as well. It's your canvas. Paint it. 


Miscellaneous
=====================

* There are two septic systems. Both have double tanks and good drain fields. I pumped both 3-4 years ago to verify I wasn't inheriting a problem. They work well. 
* The creek in the back runs year round. 
* Your neighbor (me) has a skid steer with a tree planter (and trees), so you can decorate the landscape fairly easily. 
* Zoning: Agricultural
* Traffic: The location provides easy access to everything. There's a planned bridge over the Boardman River connecting Hammond with Hartman. That bridge will not only reduce Cass Road traffic but will also further enhnace area access.

No railroad-future bike path
--------------------------------

The railroad hasn't been used in nearly 2 decades. It's unusable and the train has a working route on the other side of the river (but only once a week). There is a plan to turn the existing track into a bike path like many of the other old tracks in the area. Once constructed, there will be awesome bike route downtown and out into the country. 

Natural setting
-----------------------

* The `Boardman River Nature Preserve <https://natureiscalling.org/boardman-river-nature-center>`_ is across the street and 50 yards away. Miles of trails, great dog walking, kayaking, rafting, fishing. There's a creek in your backyard and I'm guilding a 1/2 mile trail behind you. there's a conservation farm across the road to the South. My parcel is enrolled in a USDA conservation program. 
* The Robbins farm to the South and East has been put into a conservation area. 
* I've enrolled 30 acres in a USDA conservation area. 
* Check out my maps and Google Maps. This locations is a natural gem surrounded by a growing city.
